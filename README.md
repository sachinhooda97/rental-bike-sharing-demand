# rental-bike-sharing-demand
This repository contains the data analysis and machine learning algorithms used for rental bike sharing demand. 
Rental Bike Sharing Demand Prediction is a data-driven project that aims to forecast the demand for bicycles in a shared rental system. 
This project leverages machine learning and data analysis techniques to provide accurate predictions, helping bike rental providers optimize their services, ensure efficient allocation of resources, and improve the overall user experience.
#Data Source
The data used for the analysis was from datacamp
#Data Visualisation
Many graph were made using seaborn and matplotlib library and several useful analysis were done on the dataset.
#Machine learning models
three machine learning algorithms were used for train the data and these were linear regression, random forest regressor and decision tree regressor.
